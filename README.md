# Speaker Diarization Demo
This project demonstrates speaker diarization using the [pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) library. Given an input `.wav` file, the `demo.py` script performs diarization to segment speech by speaker and extracts transcriptions for each segment using Google Speech Recognition. A simple Streamlit UI allows users to select from a set of sample audios and visualize the diarized output, including speaker labels, timestamps, and transcriptions.
